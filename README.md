# Program for Trainings

Desktop app made in Windows Forms for applying for program of trainings for gyms. (NET FRAMEWORK 4.6)

# FUNCTIONALITY:

This application is designed for two types of users, admin and basic user.

As an admin user, you will have access to a range of management functionalities. You can manage program of trainings and each training in it, including setting the date, price of program training, day of week, number of trainings per week  as well as duration of training . Additionally, you can administrate groups and users within them.

As a basic user, you can browse and view programs for training as well as your personal plan. You can also make reservations for programs for training, giving you the power to plan your time and trainings in advance.

# FUTURE PLANS:

I am currently in the process of expanding this app into a web application. With this new development, the app will be even more accessible and user-friendly, thanks to the use of Angular on the frontend and ASP.NET Core as the backend
